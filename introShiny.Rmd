## What is reproducible research?

Peng, Leek, and Caffo, [Reproducible Research on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata)

* Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses... **are published with their data and software code** so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available

This is just one aspect of *reproducible research*.

In other words, *open source* for your research project.


## Why reproducible research? {.columns-2}

One of the most effective ways to promote high-quality science is to create free open-source tools that give scientists easier and cheaper ways to incorporate transparency into their daily workflow: 

* from open lab notebooks, 
* to software that tracks every version of a data set, 
* to **dynamic document generation**

## Why reproducible research? {.columns-2}

* Important to **reward scientists on the basis of good quality of research and documentation, and reproducibility of results**, rather than statistical significance
* Statistical shops could adopt software systems that **encourage accuracy and reproducibility of their software scripts** [e.g., *knitr*]
* **Public availability** of raw data and **complete scripts of statistical analyses** could be required by journals and funding agencies sponsoring new research --- e.g., as the IOM recommended in a report on omics

## Why reproducible research?

## Why reproducible research?

Although much of the focus on reproducibility is at the basic and preclinical research level, reproducibility is where we're all headed.

* [Policy: NIH plans to enhance reproducibility (*Nature*)](http://www.nature.com/news/policy-nih-plans-to-enhance-reproducibility-1.14586)
