## What is reproducible research?

Peng, Leek, and Caffo, [Reproducible Research on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/repdata)

* Reproducible research is the idea that data analyses... **are published with their data and software code** so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available

This is just one aspect of *reproducible research*.

In other words, *open source* for your research project.


## Why reproducible research?

Ioannidis, Greenland, Hlatky, Khoury, Macleod, Moher, Schulz, and Tibshirani, 2014. [*Lancet*](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673613622278)

* It is important to **reward scientists on the basis of good quality of research and documentation, and reproducibility of results**, rather than statistical significance
* Statistical shops could adopt software systems that **encourage accuracy and reproducibility of their software scripts** [e.g., *knitr*]
* **Public availability of raw data and complete scripts of statistical analyses could be required by journals and funding agencies** sponsoring new research --- e.g., as the Institute of Medicine recommended in a report on omics


## Why reproducible research?

Although much of the focus on reproducibility is at the basic and preclinical research level, reproducibility is where we're all headed.
